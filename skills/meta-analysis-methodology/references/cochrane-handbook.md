# Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions

## Overview

The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (version 6.x) is the official guide that describes in detail the process of preparing and maintaining Cochrane systematic reviews. It is the most comprehensive methodological reference for conducting intervention reviews and is widely considered the gold standard for systematic review methodology.

## 1. Planning a Review

### 1.1 Determining the Need for a Review

- Check existing reviews on the topic (Cochrane Library, PROSPERO, other databases)
- Assess whether a new review would add value beyond existing evidence syntheses
- Consider the scope: too broad reduces utility; too narrow may yield insufficient studies

### 1.2 Writing a Protocol

A protocol should be developed before beginning the review and should include:

- **Background and rationale** for the review
- **Objectives** stated clearly
- **Criteria for considering studies** (types of studies, participants, interventions, outcomes)
- **Search methods** (sources, strategy, restrictions)
- **Data collection and analysis methods** (selection, extraction, risk of bias, synthesis plan)
- **Pre-specified subgroup and sensitivity analyses**

### 1.3 Registration

- Register the protocol in PROSPERO or another suitable register
- Publish the protocol in an open-access journal if possible
- Document the registration number and date

### 1.4 Review Team

- Minimum of two reviewers for key steps (screening, data extraction, risk of bias)
- Include content expertise, methodological expertise, and statistical expertise
- Consider including a patient/consumer partner
- Assign clear roles and responsibilities

## 2. Defining the Question (PICO)

### 2.1 The PICO Framework

The review question should be structured using the PICO framework:

| Component | Description | Considerations |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **P** - Population | Who are the participants? | Age, sex, disease/condition, severity, setting |
| **I** - Intervention | What is the intervention? | Type, dose, duration, frequency, mode of delivery |
| **C** - Comparator | What is the comparison? | Placebo, no treatment, usual care, active comparator |
| **O** - Outcome | What are the outcomes? | Primary and secondary; beneficial and harmful; timing |

### 2.2 Defining Outcomes

- **Primary outcomes:** The most important outcomes for decision-making (typically 1-3)
- **Secondary outcomes:** Additional outcomes of interest
- **Outcome hierarchy:** If multiple measures exist for an outcome, pre-specify which to prefer
- **Timing:** Specify time points of interest (short-term, medium-term, long-term)
- **Adverse effects:** Always include harm outcomes

### 2.3 Types of Study Designs

- **Randomized controlled trials (RCTs):** Preferred for intervention questions
- **Non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs):** May be included when RCTs are unavailable, for rare harms, or for long-term outcomes
- **Specify acceptable designs** in the eligibility criteria

---

## 3. Searching for Studies

### 3.1 Information Sources

Minimum recommended sources:

- **Bibliographic databases:** MEDLINE (via PubMed or Ovid), Embase, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials)
- **Trial registers:** ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)
- **Other sources:** Reference lists, citation searching, contact with experts, conference proceedings, grey literature

### 3.2 Developing the Search Strategy

- Build the search around PICO elements (usually P and I; rarely helpful to search for C and O)
- Use a combination of controlled vocabulary (MeSH, Emtree) and free-text terms
- Use Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) appropriately
- Use proximity operators where available
- Employ validated search filters where appropriate (e.g., Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for RCTs)
- Do NOT use outcome terms to restrict searches (increases risk of missing relevant studies)

### 3.3 Search Documentation

- Record the full search strategy for every database
- Record the date of each search
- Record the number of records retrieved from each source
- Document any limits or filters applied

### 3.4 Managing References

- Use reference management software (e.g., EndNote, Zotero, Covidence)
- Remove duplicates systematically
- Maintain a log of all references at each stage

---

## 4. Selecting Studies

### 4.1 Screening Process

- **Two-stage process:** Title/abstract screening, then full-text screening
- **Independent screening:** At least two reviewers should independently screen records
- **Pilot testing:** Calibrate screening criteria on a sample before full screening
- **Resolve disagreements:** Through discussion or a third reviewer

### 4.2 Eligibility Criteria

Pre-specify clear, unambiguous criteria:

- **Inclusion criteria:** Study design, population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, setting, language, date
- **Exclusion criteria:** Specific reasons for exclusion (should be the inverse of inclusion criteria)
- **Operational definitions:** Define key terms to ensure consistent application

### 4.3 Documenting Selection

- Use a PRISMA flow diagram to document the selection process
- Record reasons for exclusion at the full-text stage
- List excluded studies with reasons in the review
- Contact study authors for clarification when needed

---

## 5. Collecting Data

### 5.1 Data Extraction Forms

Design data extraction forms to capture:

- **Study identification:** Authors, year, journal, country, funding
- **Study design:** RCT, cluster-RCT, cross-over, etc.
- **Participants:** Sample size, demographics, inclusion/exclusion criteria, baseline characteristics
- **Interventions:** Detailed description (TIDieR checklist), co-interventions
- **Outcomes:** Definition, measurement method, time points, unit of measurement
- **Results:** Effect estimates, sample sizes per group, means, SDs, event counts, etc.
- **Other:** Risk of bias items, funding, conflicts of interest

### 5.2 Data Extraction Process

- At least two reviewers independently extract data
- Pilot the extraction form on 2-3 studies
- Resolve discrepancies through discussion or a third reviewer
- Contact study authors for missing or unclear data
- Document any assumptions made during extraction

### 5.3 Dealing with Multiple Reports

- Link multiple reports of the same study together
- Use the most complete data source for each outcome
- Check for consistency across reports
- Identify and handle duplicate publications

## 6. Assessing Risk of Bias

### 6.1 Tool Selection

| Study Design | Recommended Tool |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Randomized trials | RoB 2 (Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, version 2) |
| Non-randomized studies | ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions) |
| Diagnostic test accuracy | QUADAS-2 |

### 6.2 RoB 2 Domains (for Randomized Trials)

1. **Bias arising from the randomization process** - sequence generation, allocation concealment, baseline differences
2. **Bias due to deviations from intended interventions** - blinding, co-interventions, switches, adherence
3. **Bias due to missing outcome data** - attrition, intention-to-treat analysis, reasons for missingness
4. **Bias in measurement of the outcome** - blinding of outcome assessors, objectivity of outcome
5. **Bias in selection of the reported result** - pre-specification of outcomes, multiple analyses, selective reporting

### 6.3 Process

- Assess risk of bias independently (at least two reviewers)
- Assess for each outcome and time point separately (where relevant)
- Use signalling questions to guide domain-level judgments
- Derive an overall risk of bias judgment per outcome
- Support each judgment with a rationale
- Present results in risk of bias tables and summary figures

## 7. Analyzing Data and Undertaking Meta-Analyses

### 7.1 When to Perform Meta-Analysis

Meta-analysis is appropriate when:

- Studies are sufficiently similar in population, intervention, comparator, and outcome
- There is no substantial clinical or methodological heterogeneity that would make pooling misleading
- There are at least two studies reporting the same outcome

Meta-analysis may NOT be appropriate when:

- Studies are too heterogeneous to combine meaningfully
- There is only one study
- Data are insufficient or reported incompletely

### 7.2 Choosing Effect Measures

**Dichotomous outcomes:**

| Measure | Properties | When to Use |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Risk Ratio (RR) | Consistent across baseline risks; intuitive | Default for most analyses |
| Odds Ratio (OR) | Mathematical properties for rare events; used in logistic regression | Case-control studies; rare events |
| Risk Difference (RD) | Absolute measure; depends on baseline risk | When absolute differences are important |

**Continuous outcomes:**

| Measure | Properties | When to Use |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Mean Difference (MD) | Same scale; intuitive | Studies use the same measurement scale |
| Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) | Combines different scales | Studies use different scales for the same construct |

### 7.3 Meta-Analysis Models

**Fixed-effect model:**
- Assumes one true effect size underlying all studies
- Weights studies by inverse variance (precision)
- Methods: Mantel-Haenszel, inverse variance, Peto
- Use when: studies are very similar; interest is in the common effect

**Random-effects model:**
- Assumes a distribution of true effect sizes
- Accounts for between-study heterogeneity (tau-squared)
- Methods: DerSimonian-Laird, restricted maximum likelihood (REML), Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman (HKSJ)
- Use when: studies are expected to differ; interest is in the average effect

### 7.4 Assessing Heterogeneity

- **Cochran's Q test:** Tests whether heterogeneity is greater than expected by chance (low power with few studies)
- **I-squared (I2):** Percentage of variability due to heterogeneity (0-100%)
  - 0-40%: might not be important
  - 30-60%: moderate heterogeneity
  - 50-90%: substantial heterogeneity
  - 75-100%: considerable heterogeneity
- **Tau-squared (tau2):** Estimate of between-study variance
- **Prediction interval:** Range within which the true effect of a future study is expected to fall

### 7.5 Investigating Heterogeneity

- **Subgroup analysis:** Compare effect sizes between pre-defined subgroups
  - Use the test for subgroup differences (chi-squared test)
  - Interpret with caution (observational comparisons within a randomized study framework)
- **Meta-regression:** Model the association between study-level characteristics and effect size
  - Requires at least 10 studies per covariate
  - Subject to ecological fallacy
- **Sensitivity analysis:** Assess robustness by removing studies, changing analytic choices

## 8. Addressing Reporting Biases

### 8.1 Types of Reporting Biases

- **Publication bias:** Studies with significant results are more likely to be published
- **Outcome reporting bias:** Outcomes with significant results are selectively reported
- **Time-lag bias:** Studies with significant results are published sooner
- **Language bias:** Studies with significant results are published in English-language journals
- **Citation bias:** Studies with significant results are more likely to be cited
- **Location bias:** Studies with significant results are published in higher-impact journals

### 8.2 Methods for Assessing Reporting Biases

**Visual methods:**
- Funnel plot: Scatter plot of effect size vs. precision (SE or sample size)
- Contour-enhanced funnel plot: Adds contours for levels of statistical significance

**Statistical tests:**
- Egger's test: Regression of effect size on standard error (for continuous outcomes)
- Begg's test: Rank correlation between effect size and variance
- Peters' test: Alternative for dichotomous outcomes
- Harbord's test: Modified test for odds ratios

**Adjustment methods:**
- Trim-and-fill: Estimates number of missing studies and adjusts the pooled estimate
- Selection models: Model the selection process explicitly
- PET-PEESE: Precision-effect test and precision-effect estimate with standard error

### 8.3 Interpretation

- Funnel plot asymmetry can result from causes other than publication bias (e.g., small-study effects, heterogeneity)
- Tests have low power with fewer than 10 studies
- Consider the totality of evidence when judging reporting bias
- Use trial register searches to identify unpublished studies

## 9. Presenting Results (Summary of Findings Tables)

### 9.1 Summary of Findings (SoF) Table

A SoF table should include:

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Outcome | Name and follow-up time |
| Assumed risk (control) | Illustrative risk in the control group |
| Corresponding risk (intervention) | Estimated risk with intervention (with 95% CI) |
| Relative effect (95% CI) | RR, OR, or HR with confidence interval |
| Number of participants (studies) | Total participants and number of contributing studies |
| Certainty of evidence (GRADE) | High, Moderate, Low, or Very Low |
| Comments | Plain-language interpretation; important notes |

### 9.2 Key Principles

- Include up to 7 most important outcomes (including adverse effects)
- Present both relative and absolute effects
- Use the GRADE approach to rate certainty of evidence
- Provide plain-language explanations
- Use GRADEpro GDT or similar software to create the table

### 9.3 Forest Plots

- Display individual study results and the pooled estimate
- Include study names, effect estimates, confidence intervals, and weights
- Show the line of no effect
- Display heterogeneity statistics (I2, tau2, chi-squared test)
- Order studies logically (by year, weight, subgroup, etc.)

## 10. Interpreting Results

### 10.1 Key Considerations

- **Direction of effect:** Does the intervention help or harm?
- **Size of effect:** Is the effect clinically meaningful?
- **Consistency:** Are results similar across studies?
- **Precision:** How wide are the confidence intervals?
- **Certainty of evidence:** How confident are we in the evidence (GRADE)?
- **Applicability:** Do the included studies reflect the target population and setting?

### 10.2 Avoiding Common Errors

- Do NOT equate "statistically significant" with "clinically important"
- Do NOT interpret a non-significant result as "no effect" -- it may reflect insufficient power
- Do NOT over-interpret subgroup analyses (risk of false positives)
- Do NOT ignore heterogeneity -- understand its sources
- Do NOT rely solely on P-values; consider effect sizes and confidence intervals
- Consider the prediction interval, not just the confidence interval for the average effect

### 10.3 Absolute vs. Relative Effects

- Report both relative and absolute effect measures
- Absolute effects depend on baseline risk (provide multiple baseline risk scenarios)
- Number Needed to Treat (NNT) = 1 / Absolute Risk Reduction
- NNT varies by baseline risk

---

## 11. Drawing Conclusions

### 11.1 Implications for Practice

- Base conclusions on the certainty of evidence, not just statistical significance
- Consider the balance of benefits and harms
- Consider values and preferences of patients
- Consider resource implications
- State clearly whether the evidence supports, refutes, or is inconclusive regarding the intervention
- Avoid making strong recommendations in systematic reviews (this is the role of guideline panels)

### 11.2 Implications for Research

- Identify gaps in the evidence
- Suggest study designs, populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes for future research
- Recommend improvements in outcome measurement or reporting
- Consider whether additional studies are likely to change the conclusions

### 11.3 Updating the Review

- Plan for updates at the protocol stage
- Monitor new evidence using search alerts
- Update when new evidence may change conclusions
- Document changes from previous versions
