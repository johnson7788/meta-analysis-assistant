# PRISMA 2020 Statement

## Overview

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement is an updated reporting guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It replaces the original PRISMA 2009 statement and reflects advances in systematic review methodology and terminology.

**Key Reference:** Page MJ, McKenzie JE, Bossuyt PM, Boutron I, Hoffmann TC, Mulrow CD, et al. The PRISMA 2020 statement: an updated guideline for reporting systematic reviews. BMJ. 2021;372:n71. doi: 10.1136/bmj.n71

### Purpose

PRISMA 2020 is designed to ensure transparent, complete, and accurate reporting of systematic reviews. It applies to systematic reviews of interventions, diagnostic test accuracy, prognosis, etiology, and other types of research questions. The checklist can be used for both reviews that include meta-analyses and those that do not.

### What Changed from PRISMA 2009

- Expanded from 27 items to 27 items with multiple sub-items
- New items on eligibility criteria, information sources, certainty of evidence, and study registration
- Renamed sections to improve clarity
- Explicit items for reporting automation tools and software
- Updated flow diagram to account for multiple databases and registers
- Emphasis on reporting deviations from the registered protocol

## PRISMA 2020 Checklist (27 Items)

| Section | Item # | Checklist Item |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **TITLE** | | |
| Title | 1 | Identify the report as a systematic review. |
| **ABSTRACT** | | |
| Abstract | 2 | Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number. |
| **INTRODUCTION** | | |
| Rationale | 3 | Describe the rationale for the review in the context of existing knowledge. |
| Objectives | 4 | Provide an explicit statement of the objective(s) or question(s) the review addresses using components such as participants, interventions, comparators, and outcomes (PICO). |
| **METHODS** | | |
| Eligibility criteria | 5 | Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review and how studies were grouped for the syntheses. |
| Information sources | 6 | Specify all databases, registers, websites, organisations, reference lists and other sources searched or consulted to identify studies. Specify the date when each source was last searched or consulted. |
| Search strategy | 7 | Present the full search strategies for all databases, registers and websites, including any filters and limits used. |
| Selection process | 8 | Specify the methods used to decide whether a study met the inclusion criteria of the review, including how many reviewers screened each record and each report retrieved, whether they worked independently, and if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process. |
| Data collection process | 9 | Specify the methods used to collect data from reports, including how many reviewers collected data from each report, whether they worked independently, any processes for obtaining or confirming data from study investigators, and if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process. |
| Data items | 10a | List and define all outcomes for which data were sought. Specify whether all results that were compatible with each outcome domain in each study were sought (e.g. for all measures, time points, analyses), and if not, the methods used to decide which results to collect. |
| | 10b | List and define all other variables for which data were sought (e.g. participant and intervention characteristics, funding sources). Describe any assumptions made about any missing or unclear information. |
| Study risk of bias assessment | 11 | Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the included studies, including details of the tool(s) used, how many reviewers assessed each study and whether they worked independently, and if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process. |
| Effect measures | 12 | Specify for each outcome the effect measure(s) (e.g. risk ratio, mean difference) used in the synthesis or presentation of results. |
| Synthesis methods | 13a | Describe the processes used to decide which studies were eligible for each synthesis (e.g. tabulating the study intervention characteristics and comparing against the planned groups for each synthesis). |
| | 13b | Describe any methods required to prepare the data for presentation or synthesis, such as handling of multi-arm studies, imputing missing summary statistics, and conversions of effect measures. |
| | 13c | Describe any methods used to tabulate or visually display results of individual studies and syntheses. |
| | 13d | Describe any methods used to synthesize results and provide a rationale for the choice(s). If meta-analysis was performed, describe the model(s), method(s) to identify the presence and extent of statistical heterogeneity, and software package(s) used. |
| | 13e | Describe any methods used to explore possible causes of heterogeneity among study results (e.g. subgroup analysis, meta-regression). |
| | 13f | Describe any sensitivity analyses conducted to assess robustness of the synthesized results. |
| Reporting bias assessment | 14 | Describe any methods used to assess risk of bias due to missing results in a synthesis (arising from reporting biases). |
| Certainty assessment | 15 | Describe any methods used to assess certainty (or confidence) in the body of evidence for an outcome. |
| **RESULTS** | | |
| Study selection | 16a | Describe the results of the search and selection process, from the number of records identified in the search to the number of studies included in the review, ideally using a flow diagram. |

### Notes on the Flow Diagram

- **Previous version vs. updated version:** For updated reviews, additional boxes on the left side depict studies from the previous version.
- **Multiple databases:** Combine counts from all databases in a single box, but report individual database counts in the text or an appendix.
- **Grey literature and registers:** Records from registers (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov) and other non-database sources are depicted on the right side.
- **Automation tools:** If automation tools were used to remove records before screening, report that count separately.
- **Reasons for exclusion:** Report specific reasons for excluding reports after full-text assessment. Use mutually exclusive categories and report the most important reason for each excluded report.

## Using the PRISMA 2020 Checklist

### When to Use

- When writing or reviewing a systematic review manuscript
- When planning a systematic review (as a prospective guide)
- During peer review of systematic review submissions
- As a teaching tool for systematic review methodology

### Key Principles

1. **Completeness:** Address every item; if an item is not applicable, state so explicitly.
2. **Specificity:** Provide enough detail for readers to replicate the review.
3. **Transparency:** Report deviations from the protocol and their rationale.
4. **Location:** Indicate where each item is addressed (page number or section).

### PRISMA Extensions

PRISMA has several extensions for specific types of reviews:

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| PRISMA-S | Search reporting |
| PRISMA-P | Protocols |
| PRISMA-IPD | Individual participant data |
| PRISMA-NMA | Network meta-analyses |
| PRISMA-DTA | Diagnostic test accuracy |
| PRISMA-ScR | Scoping reviews |
| PRISMA-Harms | Harms |
| PRISMA-Equity | Health equity |
