# Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)

## Overview

The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) is a widely used tool for assessing the quality of nonrandomized studies (cohort and case-control studies) in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It uses a "star system" in which a study is judged on three broad domains. The maximum score is 9 stars for cohort studies and 9 stars for case-control studies.

## Cohort Studies Version

### Domain Structure

| Domain | Items | Maximum Stars |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Selection | 4 items | 4 stars |
| Comparability | 1 item (2 sub-criteria) | 2 stars |
| Outcome | 3 items | 3 stars |
| **Total** | **8 items** | **9 stars** |

### Selection (Maximum 4 Stars)

#### Item 1: Representativeness of the Exposed Cohort

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Truly representative of the average [describe] in the community | 1 star |
| b) Somewhat representative of the average [describe] in the community | 1 star |
| c) Selected group of users (e.g., nurses, volunteers) | 0 stars |
| d) No description of the derivation of the cohort | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** Assess whether the exposed cohort is representative of the community or population of interest. Studies using population-based registries, random sampling, or consecutive enrollment generally warrant a star.

#### Item 2: Selection of the Non-Exposed Cohort

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Drawn from the same community as the exposed cohort | 1 star |
| b) Drawn from a different source | 0 stars |
| c) No description of the derivation of the non-exposed cohort | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** The non-exposed cohort should ideally come from the same population as the exposed cohort. If the exposed group comes from a hospital, the non-exposed group should come from the same hospital or a comparable one.

#### Item 3: Ascertainment of Exposure

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Secure record (e.g., surgical records) | 1 star |
| b) Structured interview | 1 star |
| c) Written self-report | 0 stars |
| d) No description | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** More reliable methods of exposure ascertainment (secure records, structured interviews) reduce misclassification bias. Self-report is more prone to recall bias and inaccuracy.

#### Item 4: Demonstration That Outcome of Interest Was Not Present at Start of Study

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Yes (outcome demonstrated to be absent at baseline) | 1 star |
| b) No (or not stated) | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** Studies should demonstrate that participants did not have the outcome at cohort entry. This is essential for establishing temporality. Methods include baseline screening, medical record review, or exclusion criteria.

---

### Comparability (Maximum 2 Stars)

#### Item 5: Comparability of Cohorts on the Basis of the Design or Analysis

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Study controls for the most important factor (e.g., age) | 1 star |
| b) Study controls for any additional important factor (e.g., other confounders specified a priori) | 1 star |

**Guidance:**
- The first star is awarded for controlling for the single most important confounding variable.
- The second star is awarded for controlling for any other important confounder.
- Methods of controlling: matching, stratification, multivariable adjustment, propensity scoring, restriction.
- Review authors should pre-specify which factors are "most important" and which are "additional important" based on the clinical question.
- Example: For a study of exposure X and outcome Y, age might be the most important confounder (first star), and smoking status might be the additional important confounder (second star).

---

### Outcome (Maximum 3 Stars)

#### Item 6: Assessment of Outcome

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Independent blind assessment | 1 star |
| b) Record linkage | 1 star |
| c) Self-report | 0 stars |
| d) No description | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** Objective outcome assessment methods (independent blind assessment, administrative records, registry linkage) reduce information bias. Self-reported outcomes are susceptible to differential misclassification.

#### Item 7: Was Follow-Up Long Enough for Outcomes to Occur?

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Yes (select an adequate follow-up period for the outcome of interest) | 1 star |
| b) No | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** The adequate follow-up period depends on the specific outcome. Review authors should pre-specify what constitutes "long enough" based on the natural history of the outcome. For example:
- Cancer outcomes may require 5-10 years
- Cardiovascular events may require 1-5 years
- Surgical outcomes may require weeks to months

#### Item 8: Adequacy of Follow-Up of Cohorts

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Complete follow-up: all subjects accounted for | 1 star |
| b) Subjects lost to follow-up unlikely to introduce bias: small number lost (e.g., less than 20%) or description provided of those lost suggesting no difference from those followed | 1 star |
| c) Follow-up rate less than 80% (or more than 20% loss) and no description of those lost | 0 stars |
| d) No statement | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** High attrition rates introduce potential bias. A star is awarded if follow-up is complete or near-complete (typically > 80%) and those lost are similar to those followed.

## Case-Control Studies Version

### Domain Structure

| Domain | Items | Maximum Stars |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Selection | 4 items | 4 stars |
| Comparability | 1 item (2 sub-criteria) | 2 stars |
| Exposure | 3 items | 3 stars |
| **Total** | **8 items** | **9 stars** |

### Selection (Maximum 4 Stars)

#### Item 1: Is the Case Definition Adequate?

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Yes, with independent validation (e.g., record linkage, based on self-report plus validated by another method) | 1 star |
| b) Yes, e.g., record linkage or based on self-reports | 0 stars |
| c) No description | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** Cases should be defined using objective criteria. Independent validation (e.g., pathology confirmation, clinical criteria verified by a second source) ensures that case ascertainment is accurate.

#### Item 2: Representativeness of the Cases

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Consecutive or obviously representative series of cases | 1 star |
| b) Potential for selection biases or not stated | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** Cases should represent the full spectrum of the disease. Consecutive enrollment or population-based case ascertainment reduces selection bias. Convenience samples or selective referral patterns receive no star.

#### Item 3: Selection of Controls

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Community controls | 1 star |
| b) Hospital controls | 0 stars |
| c) No description | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** Community controls (population-based) are generally preferred as they better represent the source population. Hospital controls may have their own exposures and risk factors that differ from the general population. However, hospital controls may be appropriate when the exposure is not related to hospitalization.

#### Item 4: Definition of Controls

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) No history of disease (endpoint) | 1 star |
| b) No description of source | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** Controls should be confirmed as not having the outcome of interest. This requires active screening or verification, not merely absence of a diagnosis.

---

### Comparability (Maximum 2 Stars)

#### Item 5: Comparability of Cases and Controls on the Basis of the Design or Analysis

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Study controls for the most important factor | 1 star |
| b) Study controls for any additional important factor | 1 star |

**Guidance:** Same as for cohort studies. Matching, restriction, stratification, or multivariable adjustment for key confounders. Pre-specify which factors warrant a star.

---

### Exposure (Maximum 3 Stars)

#### Item 6: Ascertainment of Exposure

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Secure record (e.g., surgical records) | 1 star |
| b) Structured interview where blind to case/control status | 1 star |
| c) Interview not blinded to case/control status | 0 stars |
| d) Written self-report or medical record only | 0 stars |
| e) No description | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** Exposure ascertainment should be as objective as possible and ideally blinded to case/control status. Blinded structured interviews and secure records minimize recall bias and interviewer bias.

#### Item 7: Same Method of Ascertainment for Cases and Controls

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Yes | 1 star |
| b) No | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** Differential ascertainment of exposure between cases and controls is a major source of bias. Both groups should be assessed using the same method, at the same time, and with the same intensity.

#### Item 8: Non-Response Rate

| Criterion | Stars |
|-----------|-------|
| a) Same rate for both groups | 1 star |
| b) Non-respondents described | 0 stars |
| c) Rate different and no designation | 0 stars |

**Guidance:** Differences in participation rates between cases and controls can introduce selection bias. A star is awarded when the response rate is the same for both groups.

## Quality Thresholds

Several thresholds have been proposed in the literature for categorizing study quality based on the NOS total score. The most commonly used thresholds are:

### Commonly Used Thresholds

| Category | Star Range | Interpretation |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Good** | 7-9 stars | High-quality study; low risk of bias |
| **Fair** | 4-6 stars | Moderate-quality study; moderate risk of bias |
| **Poor** | 0-3 stars | Low-quality study; high risk of bias |

### Alternative Thresholds (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality)

| Category | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Good quality** | 3-4 stars in Selection AND 1-2 stars in Comparability AND 2-3 stars in Outcome/Exposure |
| **Fair quality** | 2 stars in Selection AND 1-2 stars in Comparability AND 2-3 stars in Outcome/Exposure |
| **Poor quality** | 0-1 stars in Selection OR 0 stars in Comparability OR 0-1 stars in Outcome/Exposure |

### Important Notes on Thresholds

- No universally accepted threshold exists; review authors should justify their chosen thresholds
- Using the total score alone can mask important differences (e.g., a study scoring 7 with no comparability stars vs. 7 with full comparability)
- Consider reporting domain-specific scores in addition to the total
- Some methodologists recommend against using a single cutoff and instead reporting the full profile

## Using NOS in Meta-Analysis

### Incorporating Quality Scores

| Approach | Method | Considerations |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Subgroup analysis** | Compare pooled effects for Good vs. Fair vs. Poor studies | Recommended; transparent |
| **Sensitivity analysis** | Exclude Poor-quality studies and re-pool | Recommended; shows impact of quality |
| **Meta-regression** | Include NOS score as a covariate | Requires at least 10 studies; ecological fallacy risk |
| **Quality-weighted analysis** | Weight studies by NOS score | Controversial; weights become arbitrary |
| **Threshold exclusion** | Exclude studies below a threshold | May reduce power; threshold is arbitrary |

### Recommended Approach

1. Present the primary analysis with all studies
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis excluding studies judged as "Poor" quality
3. If sufficient studies, perform subgroup analysis by quality category
4. Report NOS scores for all included studies in a summary table

## Strengths and Limitations

### Strengths

- Simple and quick to administer
- Widely used and recognized (facilitates comparison across reviews)
- Applicable to both cohort and case-control studies
- Does not require extensive statistical expertise
- Available as a free tool

### Limitations

| Limitation | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Inter-rater reliability can be moderate | Consider calibration exercises; report agreement statistics |
| No formal validation study | Psychometric properties are not well established |
| Equal weighting of all items | Some items may be more important than others |
| Comparability domain is broad | Only two stars for a complex domain; requires subjective selection of confounders |
| Does not account for all biases | Missing important aspects (e.g., detection bias in some designs) |
| Threshold-based scoring | Star thresholds for quality categories are arbitrary |
| Limited guidance for specific items | Some items require judgment without detailed criteria |

### Alternatives to NOS

| Tool | Purpose | Design |
|------|---------|--------|
| ROBINS-I | Risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions | Domain-based; Cochrane recommended |
| ROBINS-E | Risk of bias in non-randomized studies of exposures | Domain-based; newer tool |
| QUIPS | Prognostic factor studies | Domain-based |
| NIH Quality Assessment Tools | Observational studies | Checklist-based |
| JBI Critical Appraisal Tools | Various study designs | Checklist-based |

## Practical Tips

1. **Pre-specify confounders** for the Comparability domain before beginning the assessment
2. **Pre-specify adequate follow-up duration** for the Outcome domain before assessment
3. **Pilot the NOS** on 2-3 studies with all reviewers to calibrate judgments
4. **Use at least two independent assessors** and report inter-rater agreement (e.g., kappa statistic)
5. **Document rationale** for each star awarded or not awarded
6. **Present full item-level scores**, not just the total, to allow readers to assess which aspects are problematic
7. **Consider using modified versions** of the NOS if the standard version does not adequately capture biases relevant to the review question
